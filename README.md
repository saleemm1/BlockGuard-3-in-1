# BlockGuard-3-in-1


Service Navigation Application
## Description
This application provides a navigation interface for three services:

KeyGuardian: Securely manage dynamic keys.
HashFlow: Generate SHA256 proof hashes.
DefiSense: Analyze smart contract code for vulnerabilities.
Developed using Python's tkinter library for a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Features
Dynamic Key Generation: Securely generate and display unique keys.
Hash Generation: Input any text to generate a SHA256 hash.
Smart Contract Analysis: Identify potential vulnerabilities in smart contracts.
User-Friendly Interface: Services are accessible via a clean and organized layout.


## Installation
